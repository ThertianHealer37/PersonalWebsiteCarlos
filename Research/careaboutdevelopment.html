        The inspiration for this career is connected by my family and the place in which we were raised. My birth in South America has provided a perspective outside of the United States lived experience and academic thought. This different perspective compelled my objective to assist those who live in the least developed areas of the world, such as my country of birth Venezuela. I still recollect living in Venezuela and observing the poverty that surrounded my familyâ€™s history, which was physically visible. My mother was raised in one the poorest areas of our country and had no access to clean water, electricity or stable housing. The conflict of violence within a country showed itself by taking away family members such as my father and many of my family members' lives. These institutions which keep poverty within my country are the emotional motivation for my studies in developmental economics. The institutions which create poverty traps which maintain poverty in my country are shared with many of the Southern American countries, with addition there are distinct institutions which keep Venezuela poor. Tackling all poverty within Venezuela is not something that one human could achieve, however finding solutions to the small burdens is an area of activity I will engage with.
